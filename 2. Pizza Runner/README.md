## PART 0 - Data Transformation & Cleaning
`Customer_orders` table consists of indistinct and null values. Create a temporary table with modified data. Alternatively, the original table can also be modified.
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    pizza_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
        ELSE exclusions
    END AS exclusions,
    CASE 
        WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
        ELSE extras 
    END AS extras,
    order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```

`runner orders` table also consists of indistinct and null values. Transform the data by creating a temporary table.
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,  
  CASE
	  WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE pickup_time
	  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE
	  WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
	  ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE
	  WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' from duration)
	  ELSE duration
	  END AS duration,
  CASE
	  WHEN cancellation IS NULL or cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE cancellation
	  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
```

Transforming the data changes the data type to varchar by default. Use `Alter` function to correct the data type.
```sql
ALTER TABLE runner_orders_temp
ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE TIMESTAMP USING nullif(pickup_time, '')::timestamp,
ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE DOUBLE PRECISION USING nullif(distance, '')::DOUBLE PRECISION,
ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE INTEGER USING nullif(duration, '')::INTEGER,
ALTER COLUMN cancellation TYPE VARCHAR USING nullif(cancellation, '')::VARCHAR;
```
